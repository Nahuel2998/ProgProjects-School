** Description
My config files.

** Files
*** .vimrc
My vimrc, optimized for Colemak-DH (the keyboard layout I use).

*** config.lua
My lvim config file.
Doesn't have much different from the default config, but changing two lines takes too long.

*** colemak-dh-sym.kbd
KMonad config file for a Colemak-DH layout, doesn't have much fancy stuff. 

I use it when I don't have my usual keyboard.
