** Introduction
This is a general repo for all my school projects. 
And well, for things that are also not school projects.

This is probably not how you should use Git, but oh well.
It's just easier for me to have everything in one repo.

** Folders
*** libs
Here are my libraries. 
(Mostly C#)

*** configfiles
My general configfiles.
(Vim and Colemak config)

*** ProgIIProjects-UCU
My university's Programacion II projects.
(First experiences with C#)

*** Algoritmos-UCU
My university's Algoritmos y Estructuras de Datos projects.
(Java, yeah)

*** PersonalExperiments
My own personal projects.
(Varied, mostly unnecessarily elaborate jokes)
