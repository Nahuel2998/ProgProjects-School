** Description
My libraries.

They're used in my C# PersonalExperiments projects.

They aren't that polished, I was still finding out about C# when I wrote them.

** Projects
*** NarLib
General project with uhhh classes and uhhhhhhhhh yeah.

+ Menu.cs: Create and render Menus. Dumb and complicated.
+ GetValidInput.cs: A terrible idea. Not used anywhere.
+ TextScroller.cs: Scrolls text. Actually pretty cool.

*** NarExtensions
Extension methods.

That should be self-explanatory.
